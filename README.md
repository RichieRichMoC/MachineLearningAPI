In this structure, we organize our dataset, trained models, code files, and additional resources for seamless project management.

Technical Content:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Begin by loading and exploring the patient dataset to understand its structure and features.
Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model development.
Train various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. API Development with FastAPI:
Create a FastAPI application to serve as the backbone of our sepsis prediction system.
Define API endpoints for data ingestion, model prediction, and result retrieval.
Implement robust error handling and input validation to ensure the API's reliability and security.
4. Real-Time Prediction and Integration:
Deploy the FastAPI application to a cloud server for real-time accessibility.
Integrate the API into existing healthcare systems or applications for seamless usage by medical professionals.
Demonstrate the API's capabilities through a user-friendly interface or documentation.

##  Conclusion/Recommendations:In conclusion, our project demonstrates the immense potential of AI and real-time data analysis in transforming healthcare delivery. By accurately predicting sepsis onset and enabling timely intervention, our FastAPI-based solution has the power to save lives and improve patient outcomes significantly. Moving forward, we recommend continuous monitoring and refinement of the prediction models to enhance accuracy and reliability further.
